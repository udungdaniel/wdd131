    <h1>Personal Portfolio Website - Site Plan</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> CodeCraft by John Doe</p>
        <p>This name reflects my personal brand as a developer, combining "code" (technical skill) and "craft"
            (creativity and polish). It is unique, professional, and clearly connected to the content of my portfolio
            site.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>2. Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>This website is a personal portfolio to present my skills in web development. It will include completed
            coding projects, technical abilities, a contact form for potential clients/employers, and a blog section to
            share my web development journey.</p>
